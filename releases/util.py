def parse_changelog(path, **kwargs):
    """
    Load and parse changelog file from ``path``, returning data structures.

    This function does not alter any files on disk; it is solely for
    introspecting a Releases ``changelog.rst`` and programmatically answering
    questions like "are there any unreleased bugfixes for the 2.3 line?" or
    "what was included in release 1.2.1?".

    For example, answering the above questions is as simple as::

        changelog = parse_changelog("/path/to/changelog")
        print("Unreleased issues for 2.3.x: {}".format(changelog['2.3']))
        print("Contents of v1.2.1: {}".format(changelog['1.2.1']))

    Aside from the documented arguments, any additional keyword arguments are
    passed unmodified into an internal `get_doctree` call (which then passes
    them to `make_app`).

    :param str path: A relative or absolute file path string.

    :returns:
        A dict whose keys map to lists of ``releases.models.Issue`` objects, as
        follows:

        - Actual releases are full version number keys, such as ``"1.2.1"`` or
          ``"2.0.0"``.
        - Unreleased bugs (or bug-like issues; see the Releases docs) are
          stored in minor-release buckets, e.g. ``"1.2"`` or ``"2.0"``.
        - Unreleased features (or feature-like issues) are found in
          ``"unreleased_N_feature"``, where ``N`` is one of the major release
          families (so, a changelog spanning only 1.x will only have
          ``unreleased_1_feature``, whereas one with 1.x and 2.x releases will
          have ``unreleased_1_feature`` and ``unreleased_2_feature``, etc).

    Create a dummy Sphinx app, filling in various hardcoded assumptions.

    For example, Sphinx assumes the existence of various source/dest
    directories, even if you're only calling internals that never generate (or
    sometimes, even read!) on-disk files. This function creates safe temp
    directories for these instances.

    It also neuters Sphinx's internal logging, which otherwise causes verbosity
    in one's own test output and/or debug logs.

    Finally, it does load the given srcdir's ``conf.py``, but only to read
    specific bits like ``extensions`` (if requested); most of it is ignored.

    All args are stored in a single ``**kwargs``. Aside from the params listed
    below (all of which are optional), all kwargs given are turned into
    'releases_xxx' config settings; e.g. ``make_app(foo='bar')`` is like
    setting ``releases_foo = 'bar'`` in ``conf.py``.
