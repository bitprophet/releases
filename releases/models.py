          return ``Spec(">=2")``.

              behavior is nullified, and this function always returns the empty
              ``Spec`` (which matches any and all versions/lines).

        * For bugfix-like issues, we only consider major release families which
          have actual releases already.

            * Thus the core difference here is that features are 'consumed' by
              upcoming major releases, and bugfixes are not.

        * When the ``unstable_prehistory`` setting is ``True``, the default
          spec starts at the oldest non-zero release line. (Otherwise, issues
          posted after prehistory ends would try being added to the 0.x part of
          the tree, which makes no sense in unstable-prehistory mode.)
